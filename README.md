# Delimitation of *Myrcia* species using deep learning

The aim of this project is to investigate how useful representations of herbarium specimens learned by deep neural networks are in the species delimitation workflow.

Eventually this pipeline should include scripts for:

- [ ] Masking specimens from sheets using segmentation
- [ ] Training a classifier on a large image dataset
- [ ] Training a self-supervised model on a large image dataset
- [ ] Evaluating the performance of features extracted from these large models on downstream tasks
- [ ] Hierarchical clustering of features for species delimitation

## Structure

All functions and classes used for the analysis should be in the `delimitation_pipeline` folder that should be set up like a little local package.

All scripts for training models, making predictions, and delimiting species, should be at the top level.

All data for ingesting should be in the `data` folder, this includes all images. All data generated by scripts should be in the `output` folder.
