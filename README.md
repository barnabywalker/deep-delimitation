# Delimitation of species using deep learning

This repository contains code to train deep neural networks on large herbarium specimen image datasets, hopefully to learn generalisable representations that can be used to help delimit species concepts.

So far, the pipeline has functions to train a classifier and a self-supervised network to extract features from herbarium specimen images which can be used as the input for hierarchical clustering.

The training runs of these networks can be viewed on [this Weights & Biases page](https://wandb.ai/barnabywalker/species-delimitation/overview).

## Structure

All functions and classes used for the analysis should be in the `delimitation_pipeline` folder that should be set up like a little local package.

All scripts for training models, making predictions, and delimiting species, should be at the top level.

All data for ingesting should be in the `data` folder, this includes all images. All data generated by scripts should be in the `output` folder.
